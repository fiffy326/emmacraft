# Emmacraft

My personal Minecraft tweaks.

## Features

- Added '/deathcoords' command, which prints the coordinates of your most recent death.
- Added '/portalcoords' command, which converts nether coordinates for portal linking.
- Added '/coords' command, which sends your current coordinates in chat.
- Added 'glape' cat block.
